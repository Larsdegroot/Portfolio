# Influenza activity across europe

Influenza, commonly called the flu, is an infectious disease caused by The influenza virus. Symptoms can be quite mild; fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Or severe pneumonia, which can sometimes be attributed to a second respiratory infection by a bacteria. Influenza has a history of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks. There are seasonal epidemic outbreaks of influenza during the winter months when the humidity and temperatures are low, which favors transmission. There have also been four pandemics outbreaks of influenza since 1918. These pandemics happen when a Influenza strain from either an avian or swine population spreads to humans. The resulting strain is antigenically different from existing from previous circulating strains. Thus resulting in a fast transmission through a population which has yet to build up immunity. [@Krammer2018]

Dengue fever, commonly called "break bone fever" is a disease caused by the dengue virus. It is transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical environments around the equator. Symptoms can be fever, headache and vomiting or in sever cases dengue hemorrhagic fever can occur, which is when the vascular permeability is increased causing a decrease in blood pressure.

## Loading and colapsing data

The files "dengue_data.txt" and "flu_data.txt" are orginate from goolgle. Data Source: [Google Flu Trends](http://www.google.org/flutrends). 
the gapminder data comes from the package [{dslabs}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dslabs/index.html) 

```{r}
dengue <- read.csv(here::here("data/dengue_data.txt"), skip = 11) 
flu <- read.csv(here::here("data/flu_data.txt"), skip = 11)
data("gapminder")
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(head(flu, n = 10)) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_material() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

***

The data for influenza and dengue activity is not in a tidy format. Also the data in the gapminder dataset is per year, while the data for influenza and dengue activity is per week. By collapsing the data for flu and dengue activity the joining of these three datasets will be possible.

```{r 7.2}
dengue <- dengue %>% pivot_longer(Argentina:Venezuela, names_to = "country", values_to = "value")
flu <- flu %>% pivot_longer(Argentina:Uruguay, names_to = "country", values_to = "value")
```

```{r 7.3}
dengue <- dengue %>% separate("Date", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") 

dengue <- dengue[-c(2,3)] #removing month and day
dengue$year <- as.integer(dengue$year)
dengue$country <- as.factor(dengue$country)

dengue <- dengue %>% 
            group_by(year, country) %>% 
            summarise("country" = country, "dengue_activity" = sum(value, na.rm = T)) %>%
            unique()


flu <- flu %>% separate("Date", into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") 

flu <- flu[-c(2,3)] #removing month and day
flu$year <- as.integer(flu$year)
flu$country <- as.factor(flu$country)

flu <- flu %>% 
        group_by(year, country) %>% 
        summarise("country" = country, "influenza_activity" = sum(value, na.rm = T)) %>%
        unique()

```
`r table_port7("flu_collapse")`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(head(flu, n = 10)) %>%
  kable_material(full_width = FALSE)
```
## Storing new dataframes 

```{r, eval=F}
#storing dataset locally
for (x in c("flu", "dengue", "gapminder")) {
  export(get(x), path = paste0(here("output//"), x))
}

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
psswd <- .rs.askForPassword("Database Password:")

con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), 
                 dbname = "workflowsdb", 
                 host="localhost", 
                 port="5432", 
                 user="postgres", 
                 password=psswd)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#storing datasets on Dbeaver
dbWriteTable(con, "dengueDB", dengue, overwrite = T)
dbWriteTable(con, "fluDB", flu, overwrite = T)
dbWriteTable(con, "gapminderDB", gapminder, overwrite = T)
````

`r fig_port7("dbeaver")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/workflowsdb_in_Dbeaver.JPG"))
```

Checking if the datasets are accessible: 

```{sql connection= con}
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  "dengueDB" 
WHERE 
  country = 'Argentina';
```

```{sql connection= con}
SELECT 
  *  
FROM 
  "fluDB" 
WHERE
  country = 'Netherlands';
```

```{sql connection= con}
SELECT 
  year,
  population,
  life_expectancy
FROM 
  "gapminderDB"
WHERE
  country = 'Netherlands' AND
  year >= 2002;

```



```{r}
db_names <- c("fluDB", "dengueDB", "gapminderDB")

tables <- list()
for (i in db_names){
   tables[[paste(i)]] <- dbReadTable(con, i)
}
```

## Joining dataset

To join the Influenza and dengue dataset with the gapminder dataset there is one problem: 

```{r, results='hold'}
tables$fluDB$year %>% unique()
tables$dengueDB$year %>% unique()
```

The data of `flu` and `dengue` are from the year 2002 until 2015. while the data of gapminder is from:

```{r, results='hold'}
tables$gapminderDB$year %>% min()
tables$gapminderDB$year %>% max()
```
1960 till 2016. Also the datasets contain data about different countries:

```{r, results='hold'}
amount_factor(tables$fluDB$country)
amount_factor(tables$dengueDB$country)
amount_factor(tables$gapminderDB$country)
```
```{r}
levelF <- tables$fluDB$country %>% as.factor %>% levels()
levelD <- tables$dengueDB$country %>% as.factor %>% levels()
levelG <- tables$gapminderDB$country %>% as.factor %>% levels()

common(levelD, levelG) %>% length() == length(levelD) #common countries with gapminder equal to total countries of dengue
```

All the countries in the dengue data set are all also in the gapminder dataset. However the influenza dataset contains countries that the gapminder dataset does not.

```{r}
common(levelF, levelG) %>% length() == length(levelF) #common countries with gapminder equal to total countries of influenza
levelF[!levelF %in% common(levelF, levelG)] # the countries not in gapminder
```

If the tables are to be joined they need to have data about only the countries and years equal to the countries and years that the tables have in common. Or the tables need to be joined in a way that `NA` is introduced where necessary.

```{r}
#trimming the gapminder dataset so it contains the data of the same dates as the influenza and dengue dataset
gapminder_02_15 <- tables$gapminderDB %>% filter(between(year, 2002, 2015))
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
dbWriteTable(con, "gapminder_02_15DB", gapminder_02_15, overwrite = T)
```

```{sql connection = con, eval = F}
CREATE TABLE joined_gapfluden 
AS SELECT "gapminder_02_15DB".*, "fluDB".influenza_activity, "dengueDB".dengue_activity 
FROM "gapminder_02_15DB"
LEFT JOIN "fluDB" ON public."fluDB".year = public."gapminder_02_15DB".year 
AND public."fluDB".country = public."gapminder_02_15DB".country
LEFT JOIN "dengueDB" ON public."dengueDB".year = public."gapminder_02_15DB".year
AND public."dengueDB".country = public."gapminder_02_15DB".country
```


```{r}
joined_gapfluden <- dbReadTable(conn = con, "joined_gapfluden")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(con)
```

The joined dataset contains data about `r joined_gapfluden["country"] %>% unique() %>% count() %>% pull()` different countries, during the time period from `r joined_gapfluden["year"] %>% min` until `r joined_gapfluden["year"] %>% max`. And also the influenza cases per country during this time.

```{r}
joined_gapfluden$country <- joined_gapfluden$country %>% as.factor()
joined_gapfluden$year <- joined_gapfluden$year %>% as.factor()
joined_gapfluden$continent <- joined_gapfluden$continent %>% as.factor()
joined_gapfluden$region <- joined_gapfluden$region %>% as.factor()
```

`r table_port7("joined_table")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(head(joined_gapfluden)) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", box_css = "border: 0px;")
```

## Visualizing data

in 2009 a strain of influenza, the H1N1 influenza strain caused a pandemic known as the swine flu. The European countries who had the most influenza cases are:

```{r}
EU_flu <- joined_gapfluden %>% 
            dplyr::filter(continent == "Europe", influenza_activity >= 10000) %>%
            dplyr::select(country) %>% 
            unique() %>%
            dplyr::pull() %>%
            as.vector() %>%
            print()
```

`r fig_port7("flu_per_country")`

```{r, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
joined_gapfluden %>% 
  filter(country %in%  EU_flu) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= year, y = influenza_activity, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +
  theme_ipsum() +
  scale_color_ipsum() +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=2))+
  labs(y = "influenza cases") 
```

Global cases peaked in 2009 at `r joined_gapfluden %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(global_influenza_cases = sum(influenza_activity, na.rm = T)) %>% pull() %>% max() `.

Some countries had more influenza cases relative to their population during the peak than others.

`r fig_port7("map")`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
relative_influenza_2009 <- joined_gapfluden %>% 
  dplyr::filter(continent == "Europe", year == "2009") %>% 
  dplyr::select(country, population, influenza_activity) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(relative_influenza_cases = (influenza_activity / population)*100)

regions <- relative_influenza_2009$country
#remove Russia because it takes up too much space in the map
regions <- regions[-11]

map_data_eu <- map_data("world", region = regions)

relative_influenza_2009 <- relative_influenza_2009 %>% filter(country != "Russia")
#renaming for left join
relative_influenza_2009 <- rename(relative_influenza_2009, region = country)
map_data_eu <- left_join(relative_influenza_2009, map_data_eu, by = "region")

ggplot(map_data_eu, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group, fill = relative_influenza_cases), colour = "white", size = 0.1) +
  theme_void(base_family = font_an) + #maybe a dark theme?
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "E") + 
  labs(title = "Influenza activity in Europe",
       fill = "relative influenza activity",
       caption = "grey means no data")
  
```

It is visible that Austria was had a relatively high influenza activity. Could this have effected life expectancy in Austria?

`r fig_port7("life_exp")`

```{r, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
joined_gapfluden %>%
  filter(country == "Austria") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = life_expectancy), group = 1, size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = influenza_activity/500), group = 1, inherit.aes = F, size = 1, color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Life Expectancy in years",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*500, name = "Influenza cases")
  ) +
  theme_ipsum()
  
```
