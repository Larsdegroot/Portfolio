# Portfolio assignment 5.B

**1. Make a new folder within Mendeley for the projecticum. Place all pdf’s you used till now in your folder (if you did not use any papers as source yet, find 3 papers on Pubmed now that you could use for your introduction.). Copy your .bib file to the folder on your computer you are using for the Projecticum git repo.**

I've searched for 3 paper about de novo assembly.
_Our projecticum doesn't require a literature study_

**2. Start a .Rmd named “introduction.Rmd” with a few lines introduction on your projecticum topic.**

**3. Include automatic inline references to the papers you used.**

**4. The bibliography will be placed at the end of the document. Provide an appropriate header.**

**5. Merge your work with that of your projecticum partner through github. Solve all the problems you encounter. If github does not want to merge .bib files and you want a merged one, try here.**

**6. Find out how you can add websites as reference to Mendeley.**

**7. Write (so not “copy!”) at least 500 words of introduction for your projecticum project and use at least 5 references.**
_this won't be an introduction but more of a summary_
