# _C. elegans_ plate experiment

The data used in this report comes from a experiment where _C. elegans_ was exposed to varying concentrations of three different compounds: 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene, decane and naphthalene. After an incubation period the number of offspring where counted.  

```{r}
#first excel sheet is read
ce_data <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx"))
names(ce_data)
```


The Excel file contains a lot of data not necessary for this report. The variable used in this report are:
* expType:               Experiment type
* RawData:               Number of offspring
* compName:              Compound name
* compConcentration:     Compound concentration
* compUnit:              Unit of measurement  


```{r)}
#getting rid of unnecessary columns
ce_data <- dplyr::select(ce_data, c("expType", "RawData", "compName", "compConcentration", "compUnit"))
knitr::kable(head(ce_data, n = 10))
```
`r table_port1("ce_head")`


```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Certain columns where missclassed by read_xlsx(), correcting:
ce_data$compConcentration <- as.numeric(ce_data$compConcentration)
ce_data$compName <- as_factor(ce_data$compName)
```

The compound were tested at different concentration gradients per compound. A decrease in offspring count can be seen with the increase of each compounds concentration

```{r}
iso <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene") %>%
        ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene")

decane <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "decane") %>%
        ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "Decane")

naph <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "naphthalene") %>%
        ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData)) +
        ggplot2::geom_point() +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "Naphthalene")
```

```{r}
ggarrange(iso, decane, naph)
```

`r fig_port1("dotplot")`

However the experiment was designed with the creation of a dose-response curve in mind. So the compound concentration is on a logarithmic scale. 
 
```{r}
#removed geom_smooth linear method
iso <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene" | compName == "S-medium") %>%

        ggplot2::geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth() +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene")

decane <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "decane" | compName == "S-medium") %>%
        ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData)) +
        ggplot2::geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth() +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "Decane")

naph <- ce_data %>% 
        dplyr::filter(compName == "naphthalene" | compName == "S-medium") %>%
        ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData)) +
        ggplot2::geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
        ggplot2::geom_smooth() +
        ggplot2::labs(x = "Compand concentration in nM",
                      y = "Number of offspring",
                      title = "Naphthalene")
```


```{r}

`r fig_port1("iso_log", display = "c")`, `r fig_port1("decane_log", display = "c")` and `r fig_port1("naph_log", display = "c")` are supposed to resemble dose response curves, however geom_smooth method of applying a curve to the data points isn't meant for creating a dose response curve. A package which is meant for this is [{drc}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/index.html).

The model to be fitted to the response data will be a four parameter log-logistic function, abbreviated to LL.4 in {drc}. this means that 1 out of the five parameters are pre-set, which are f = 1. 
Normally LL.3 would be used where c is set to 0, because the response data is discrete (number of offspring). However this doesn't produce a good fit, because there no datapoints where the number of offspring is actually zero.
