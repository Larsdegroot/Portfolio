# RMDutil package
 
i have made an R package called RMDutil. it's nothing much accept a few custom functions that i often use. Two of which i feel can be useful to almost anyone writing RMD documents. The functions `capture_package_name()` and `format_version()`, which enable the user to format a typical code chunk that load package with their respective version numbers.
